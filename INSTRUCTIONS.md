## Instructions

### Part A: Study the Reference (5 min)
Read `REFERENCE.md` in this folder — it explains every field in a JIRA ticket.

### Part B: Analyze a Sample Ticket (10 min)
Open `sample_ticket.md` and answer these questions in your head (or write them down):

1. **What type of task is this?** (Bug Fix / Feature Ship / Maintenance / Debugging)
2. **Who reported it and why?**
3. **What is the deadline?**
4. **List all acceptance criteria** — what must be true for this to be "done"?
5. **Where is the code?** Which files do you need to look at?
6. **Is there any extra context?** (Slack threads, design docs, PR comments)

### Self-Check
If you can answer all 6 questions for any ticket in under 60 seconds, you're ready.
